Exploring Twitter Database with SQL:

This project is about organizing and analyzing a Twitter-like database using SQL. It includes creating tables, adding data, and running queries to get useful insights.

Key Highlights:

Database Normalization: Redesigned the raw database to follow Third Normal Form (3NF), reducing redundancy and improving data organization.
Database Creation: Created new tables based on the normalized design and imported the data using PostgreSQL.

Advanced SQL Queries: Cleaned, transformed, and explored the data using techniques like:

Joins
Aggregate functions
Subqueries
Unions

Whatâ€™s in This Project:

create.sql: SQL script to create normalized database tables.
insert.sql: SQL script to populate the database with sample data.
queries.sql: SQL queries to analyze the data and extract insights.
Project_Report.pdf: A detailed document explaining the database structure, normalization, and query outputs.

Tools Used:
PostgreSQL
SQL Queries
Data Normalization Techniques (1NF, 2NF, 3NF)
Why This Project Is Useful

This project demonstrates how to:

Normalize a raw dataset for better efficiency.
Use SQL to clean, transform, and analyze data.
Apply advanced SQL techniques to uncover insights from large datasets.
